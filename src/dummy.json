Lineup * Jay-J (Shifted Music) * Chad Bays (Here & Now | Pool Party) * Jason Godfrey (Lose Control) * Glade Luco (Boudoir) * Mark O&#39;Brien (Polyglamorous) Jay-J Biography In the world of dance music production, Jay-J has forged the reputation as the producer with the &quot;Midas touch&quot;. He is known for his signature &#39;sexy, soulful, dance floor driven&#39; style blending elements of funk, soul and disco combined with sultry vocals. Many of the dance industry&#39;s top icons including Kaskade, Miguel Migs, Marques Wyatt, Halo, Julius Papp, Mark Grant and Chris Lum have collaborated with Jay-J at his Moulton Studios, one of the most respected production houses often credited with the creation of the “San Francisco Sound”. These sessions produced some of the biggest contemporary dance releases that also caught the attention of music professionals. In 2003, Jay-J received a GRAMMY® nomination for his re-mix of Jill Scott’s &quot;He Loves Me&quot;. He has also re-mixed the music of other notable artists including Joss Stone, Airpushers featuring Motown’s legendary Lamont Dozier, Alicia Keys, David Gray, Lil&#39; Kim, Koffee Brown and gospel great, Donnie McClurkin. Jay-J then released his latest compilation CD, Re:Souled | The Shifted Music Remix Collection and the Latrice album, Illuminate (Ultra), which he co-produced with Kaskade to wrap up the year. 2007 kicked off with the release of Jay-J & Friends Volumes 1-3, the complete collection of re-mastered tracks from his Moulton Studio Recordings and Multitracked catalogues as well as select classic productions spanning the past 15 years.

                "description": " <br> Lee Ritenour, (born Lee Mack Ritenour, 11 January 1952, Los Angeles, CA, USA) has maintained a delicate balance between the individual creative vision and the group dynamic, since the beginning of his career. He did his first session work in the late 60s with the Mamas and the Papas, who dubbed him Captain Fingers for demonstrating incredible dexterity while still in his teens.Since his early recordings in the 1970s, he has earned a GRAMMY Award and 19 GRAMMY nominations, numerous #1 spots on guitar polls, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian SJ Awards, and a prestigious Alumnus of the Year Award from the University of Southern California. He has recorded more than 40 albums that have yielded 35 chart songs. As a young guitarist, he put his combination of diverse musical styles and brilliant technical chops to work on more than 3,000 sessions with a broad spectrum of artists, and was a founding member of Fourplay, which is considered the most successful group in contemporary jazz.Lee celebrated five decades as a guitarist in 2010 with the release of 6 String Theory, which features Steve Lukather, Neal Schon, John Scofield, Slash, Mike Stern, George Benson and B.B. King. The album also introduced Andy McKee, Joe Robinson and Guthrie Govan. The record was in conjunction with his first multi-national 6 String Theory Competition, sponsored by Yamaha, Berklee College of Music, Montreux Jazz Festival, Blue Note Tokyo, Crown of the Continents Guitar Workshop and Festival, Monster, Premier Guitar, Jazz Monthly, Music Connection, Concord Records and DAddario.The Six String Theory competition continues to grow, and has now expanded to include a Rhythm Section competition for Piano, Bass and Drums. In 2012, the Grand Prize winners were honored to appear with Lee on Rhythm Sessions, which also features luminaries such as Chick Corea, George Duke, Stanley Clarke, Dave Grusin, Marcus Miller and many others. The 2014 winners performed at the illustrious Montreux Jazz Festival and the guitar grand prize winner, Tony Pusztai, recorded a track on Ritenours 2015 A Twist of Rit album starring greats such as: Academy & Grammy winning Dave Grusin, Dave Weckl, John Beasley, and Ernie Watts.Prize highlights for the 2016 competition included: Berklee College of Music Scholarships; performance at the legendary Blue Note Tokyo with Lee Ritenour and up-and-coming All-Star musicians from Japan; recording on Lee Ritenours forthcoming album at the stunning Woodshed Recording Studio in Malibu and Scholarships and Performances at Crown Guitar Festival in scenic Montana. Other prizes include travel and hotel for performance and recording opportunities, Yamaha Instruments & Endorsements, Professional Mentoring with Lee Ritenour, Monster and DAddario prizes.When I first started this competition it was my hope it would grow to become a valuable entity that would have the support of so many established musicians in mentoring aspiring ones. In four short years we have reached incredible goals and I couldnt be more thrilled and grateful to have so many artists be part of this extraordinary musical process and journey. - Lee RitenourOn April 22, 2016, Concord Records released The Vinyl LP Collection: a limited edition, individually numbered box set celebrating a key period in the prolific solo career of renowned guitarist Lee Ritenour. The Collection contains five classic LPs by Ritenour: Earth Run (1986), Portrait (1987), Festival (1988), Color Rit (1989) and, on vinyl for the first time, the GRAMMY Award- nominated Wes Bound (1993). These albums have each been remastered, pressed on audiophile-quality, 180-gram vinyl and restored with original artwork and liner notes. An accompanying 46-page booklet contains new liner notes by Ritenour plus never- before-seen photos and ephemera from an extensive scrapbook collection lovingly kept by the guitarists late father.",

                "description": " “Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.” (Psalm 105:2)  As you can see, the Bible plainly states that we are to sing to God and for God. By doing that, we bless each other with our gifts. Music brings people together and allows them to celebrate the wondrous life that God has bestowed upon them. Music elevates us; it comforts us and makes us happy. And of course, music can also help us through the inevitable sorrows that we encounter throughout our lives.   If you are blessed with the gift of a heavenly voice, or simply a God-given love of music, then the Praise Choir at Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church is a great way for you to express your love and to share it with the rest of the congregation. Belonging to the choir is also a great way to fellowship, because you will see your musical brothers and sisters in Christ three times a week – two rehearsals plus Sunday Service praise performance.   The choir is led by the gifted and experienced singer Althea Battle. If you are a singer, and you come out to a service and hear what she can do, there is no doubt that God will move your heart to desire to work with her. The Praise Choir infuses such joy and energy into the Sunday morning experience that you will surely want to be a part of it.  Not only that, but this distinguished musical ensemble has performed at half-time for our very own NBA world-champion basketball team, the Oakland Warriors, as well as for the Harlem Globetrotters. (Get Pastor Anthony to talk about that sometime. He is very proud of his amazing choir and director.)   Distinguished Choir Leader Althea Battle  Miss Althea comes from a musical family, so her accomplishments should not come as a surprise to anyone. Her pianist father was a gospel entertainer right here in Oakland. She has been actively performing in churches and on the popular front as an opening act for decades.   As often happens with someone with her level of talent, she finds it fulfilling to pass along the benefits of her knowledge and experience to her fellow singers. You can come to a Sunday Service and experience for yourself the amazing sounds of the choir, as well as Miss Althea’s powerful solo voice. The group is called Taylor Anointed Praise (TAP) and started with just four members. It has grown into an amazing musical group that gets the congregation in high spirits for their weekly time of worship and fellowship with each other and with the Lord.   Miss Althea stays very busy with music at Taylor. In addition to the Praise Choir, she also leads Taylor Made Men’s Chorus, Tapestry Young Adults Choir and the Musical Prodigy Youth Choir – so, no matter who you are, there is a place for you to fit into God’s plan for music at Taylor Church.   The Praise Choir performs weekly during the Sunday Service, so please come out and hear what they can do. Rehearsals are held on Wednesday evenings from 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Taylor Church main sanctuary.  ",

                "description": " Back by popular demand, we present Come & See, but this time with new songs, new faces, and new scenes! What if the life and times of Jesus happened in modern-day San Francisco?There’d be more hashtags, more coffee shops, and (because this is a musical) a lot more singing!Most importantly, we’d still see Jesus loving the unlovable, performing miracles, and speaking words that healed others but got Him crucified.Did it all end in death or did He rise again?This Easter, we invite you to come and see that while our story might look different, Jesus’ loving offer of wholeness, belonging, and life remains the same. ________  FAQs TICKETINGHow much are tickets? They’re free! Why are we ticketing? They help us track when a show fills up, so you can have the best seat available. How do the tickets work? Eventbrite will email your ticket, so either print it out or show us on your phone. It’s that simple. How many can I get? Up to five. Are seats assigned? Nope. Doors open 30 mins before show time, and seats are first come, first served. So get there early if you have specific seats in mind. What if I don’t get a ticket? You can still come, but those with tickets get in first. 10 mins before show time, those with no tickets will be let in. What if I’m late? Since seats are first come, first served, your “spot” will be given away to someone in line.   KIDS For those with kids under six: For the sake of the performers and those around you, no kids under six may sit in the sanctuary. Our church has sensitive acoustics, so sound travels easily. We ask that you either drop them off in our Kids Wing (KIDS PROGRAM ticket) or if you&#39;d prefer to sit together, please get a FAMILY ROOM ticket. NEW: During which shows will the Kids Wing be open? All Sunday shows only. So if you bring a child under six on Friday or Saturday, you will only be able to sit in the Family Room. Where is the Kids Wings? On the second and third floor if you enter by the side gate on 15 Dearborn St. Where is the Family Room?  On the second floor if you enter by the front gate.   PARKING Is there parking? Yes, but while our garage on 17th is always open, space is limited. We encourage you to take public transit or a ride share. Sundays do have a bit more flexibility with the Boys & Girls Club. Plus the 11:30A show also has Guerrero St. Is it free? Yup.   PUBLIC TRANSITHere are a few options to get to us: BART: 16th St. Mission Station and a 7 minute walk. MUNI BUS: 16th & Valencia (22 line) or 16th & Guerrero (33 line) and a 5 minute walk. MUNI METRO: Church St & 18th St (J line) and a 10 minute walk. ",
